# About this data ...
This data touches upon video games sales with ratings from as early as 1984 until the year 2016. It’s broken down between a few different categories like the platform the game was on, what genre, year it was released and even the rank. It goes into slight details of the global sale and how that affected the sales in the rest  of the world.
